# Coursera-Data-Science-Competition-Top-20
**Coursera's First-Ever Data Science Competition**

In this challenge, you will be given a real dataset from Coursera and you will be asked to build a **classification** model that predicts whether a learner will or will not be subscribed to Coursera. In this challenge, you will be using **Python and working in a Jupyter Notebook**.

**When is the competition?**

The competition begins Wednesday December 14th, 8AM (PST) and lasts through Sunday December 18th, 11:59PM (PST).

When you start the challenge, you will have 12 hours to complete it, unless you start the challenge with less than 12 hours remaining in the competition window on Sunday December 18th. The timer will begin as soon as you click “start” and will not stop, even if you leave Coursera’s website. That means if you start at 1 PM the timer will continue to countdown even if you’re not actively working on the challenge and you will no longer be able to submit by 1 AM.

**What should I know going into the challenge?**

In this challenge, you will be given a real dataset from Coursera and you will be asked to build a classification model that predicts whether a learner will or will not be subscribed to Coursera. In this challenge, you will be using Python and working in a Jupyter Notebook.

**What do the winners get?**

Participants will be judged by (1) the prediction accuracy of their model and (2) the time it takes them to get to their highest prediction accuracy -- the less time, the better. Winners will be announced the week of December 19th and those who placed in the top 50 will be contacted via email.

Winners will receive…

Top 5 Participants: 20 minutes with a Data Science hiring manager at Coursera

Top 50 Participants: Free access to select Data Science courses on Coursera
